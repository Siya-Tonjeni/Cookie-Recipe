                <p class="details-text">You’re only as good as your ingredients. These are all of the ingredients below to ensure you get a gourmet chocolate chip cookie.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.woolworths.co.za/prod/Food/Milk-Dairy-Eggs/Butter-Margarine/Butter-Spreads/Unsalted-Butter-250-g/_/A-20011840">
                        <strong>Unsalted Butter:</strong></a>
                        Using unsalted butter means that you can fully control the amount of salt going into your cookies and also ensures that it browns evenly. You’ll brown the butter for a nutty, toasty deep flavor as the base for your cookies! <strong><a href="#brown-butter">Click here</a></strong> for instructions on how to brown your butter.
                </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.woolworths.co.za/prod/Food/Pantry/Sugar-Flour-Baking/Sugar-Sweeteners/Light-Brown-Sugar-1kg/_/A-20104061">
                        <strong>Light Brown Sugar:</strong></a>  
                        The light brown sugar will keep your cookies soft and chewy and give them that delicious brown sugar-y taste.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.woolworths.co.za/prod/Food/Pantry/Sugar-Flour-Baking/Sugar-Sweeteners/White-Sugar-1-kg/_/A-6001009023957?isFromPLP=true">
                        <strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong></a>
                        A little granulated sugar will give your cookie the perfect amount of crunch on the edges. You get the best of both worlds.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Eggs:</strong></a>
                        Eggs will bind your cookies together. A single egg and one egg yolk will gives these cookies their soft, chewy, not too cakey texture.
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.woolworths.co.za/prod/Food/Pantry/Sugar-Flour-Baking/Baking-Ingredients/Vanilla-Essence-50-ml/_/A-6009173755391">
                        <strong>Vanilla Essence:</strong></a>
                        Vanilla is so essential to chocolate chip cookies. I know it might seem unimportant because you use a small amount of it, but it will take your cookies to the next level.

                        <strong>Flour:</strong></a>
                        Cake flour is my flour of choice for these chewy cookies. It creates a tender but hearty crumb.
                    </li>

                        <strong>Baking Soda:</strong></a>
                        A little baking soda will give your cookies the perfect rise and crackle on top you need.

                        <strong>Salt:</strong></a>
                        Baked goods NEED salt. Without it they’re just cloyingly sweet. Salt adds that perfectly nuanced salty-sweet flavor that pushes a baked good from good to great.

                        <strong>Chocolate:</strong></a>
                        When is comes to chocolate it really depends on you, but semi or dark chocolate goes really well with these.

        <h2>How to make brown butter:</h2>
        <p>Browning your butter gives it an amazing complexity that enhances so many recipes.</p>
        <ol class="brown-butter-details">
            <li>Start by melting your butter over medium heat in a small sauce pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk the butter constantly as it melts to ensure it’s evenly heated. As it melts the butter will start to foam. This is the sweet point between boiling the butter (NOT what you want) and not hot enough.</li>
            <li>Keep a close eye on the butter. As it transitions from its usual yellow color to a deeper golden hue and at last to a beautiful light golden brown. It can very quickly go from this light brown to burnt, so make sure you take it off the heat as soon as it makes the turn.</li>
            <li>Take it off the heat and transfer to a bowl to allow it to cool before using in your recipe.</li>

                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Brown the butter over medium heat, stirring constantly until the butter begins to foam and turns a golden brown, emitting a nutty aroma. Make sure you only brown the butter lightly. When butter browns the liquid evaporates off which can dry out your dough. As soon as the butter starts to turn brown and smell nutty, take it off the heat to prevent any more liquid from escaping.  Take butter off the heat and allow to cool.</li>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl combine the cooled brown butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Beat until mixed together. Add in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Mix well.</li>
                    <li>In separate bowl mix together the flour, salt and baking soda. Mix half the dry ingredients into the wet until everything comes together. Slowly add in the remaining flour a little bit at a time, stopping if the dough starts to get too dry. Fold in the chocolate. Do not over mix.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate the cookie dough for at least a half hour, or overnight.</li>
                    <li>When you are ready to bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 180°C and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper. Use a cookie scoop to scoop the cookie dough out into balls, placing them about 5cm apart on the prepared sheet. Bake for 12 minutes, or until the edges are just golden brown and the centers have puffed up but are still gooey.</li>
                    <li>Allow to cool before eating!</li>
